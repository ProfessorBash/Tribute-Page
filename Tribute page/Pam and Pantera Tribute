  <p>There was once was a cat with a hungry belly</p>
  <p>The name of the cat was whiskers jelly</p>
  <p>His throat was dry and his bowl was bare</p>
  <p>Meow me furry cats, meow</p>
  <p>Soon may the kittyman come</p>
  <p>With birds and mice and some tasty nums</p>
  <p>One day when the critters come</p>
  <p>We'll eat ’til our bellies are full</p>
  <p>Well jelly got his boys and they gathered 'round</p>
  <p>They scattered seeds from a sack they found</p>
  <p>In hopes the seeds they spread on the ground</p>
  <p>Will bring small critters aboot</p>
  <p>Soon may the kittyman come</p>
  <p>With birds and mice and some tasty nums</p>
  <p>One day when the critters come</p>
  <p>We'll eat ’til our bellies are full</p>
<p>Well the gang was bored and morale had</p> dipped
  <p>'Til one of the seeds grew green catnip</p>
  <p>They sniffed and they snacked and they all got ripped</p>
  <p>They all had a meow that night</p>
  <p>Soon may the kittyman come</p>
  <p>With birds and mice and some tasty nums</p>
  <p>One day when the critters come</p>
  <p>We'll eat 'til our bellies are full</p>
  <p>Well their heads were hung when the morn was nigh</p>
  <p>The nip was strong and they all got high</p>
  <p>Their bellies were shrunk and their bowls still dry</p>
  <p>Oh bring us some mice today</p>
  <p>Soon may the kittyman come</p>
  <p>With birds and mice and some tasty nums</p>
  <p>One day when the critters come</p>
  <p>We'll eat 'til our bellies are full</p>
